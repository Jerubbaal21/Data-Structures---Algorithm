# Data Structures & Algorithm (FAMILY TREE)

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.
Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

 BST Basic Operations :
The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure, are the following −
Insert − Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.

Search − Searches an element in a tree.

Preorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

Inorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

Postorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
