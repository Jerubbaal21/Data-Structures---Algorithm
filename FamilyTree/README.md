# Data Structures & Algorithm (FAMILY TREE)

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.
Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

 BST Basic Operations :
The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure, are the following −
Insert − Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.

Search − Searches an element in a tree.

Preorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

Inorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

Postorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.

THE MAIN CLASS
The program runs from this class. It performs the following operations.
1. linkedlist insertion
2. list display *adding at the font
3. adding at a specific position
4. display final list

DDLinkedlist
This class defines the following methods
1. add method
2. add at the end method
3. dd at position method
4. delete from front
5. delete from end
6. delete at position
7. display list
NODE
This class basically declares the variables node, next, previous.

RUN CODE
To run the this program. Create three class (main.java, DDLinkedlist.java, node.java)in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java.
