# Data Structures & Algorithm (STACK)

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

HOW IT WORKS

This program has the following

1. stackArrayImplementation.java
2. main method
3. StackArrayImplementation constructor
4. Push method
5. pop method
6. display method *undo prompt method

POP METHOD

removes an element from the stack

PUSH METHOD

adds an element to the stack

PEEK METHOD

retrieves or fetches an element

UNDO METHOD

prompts the user whether to undo

MAIN METHOD

It has the following instructions
1. insertion
2. dispay initial elements of stack
3. prompts user to undo
4. validates input
5. implements input

RUN CODE

To run the this program. Create stackArrayImplementation.java class in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java.
