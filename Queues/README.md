# Data Structures & Algorithm (QUEUES)
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

Basic Operations :
Queue operations may involve initializing or defining the queue, utilizing it, and then completely erasing it from the memory. Here we shall try to understand the basic operations associated with queues −

enqueue() − add (store) an item to the queue.

dequeue() − remove (access) an item from the queue.

Few more functions are required to make the above-mentioned queue operation efficient. 
These are −

1. peek() − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

2. isfull() − Checks if the queue is full.

3. isempty() − Checks if the queue is empty.

In queue, we always dequeue (or access) data, pointed by front pointer and while enqueing (or storing) data in the queue we take help of rear pointer.

THE MAIN CLASS
The program runs from this class. It performs the following operations.
1. insertion into queue
2. queue display and size
3. delete from queue
4. display queue after deletion

1. node class
2. value assigning constructor
3. insertion method
4. deletion method
5. queue diplay method
