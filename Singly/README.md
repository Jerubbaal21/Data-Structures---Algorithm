# Data Structures & Algorithm (SINGLY)
Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence. In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "Node". Every "Node" contains two fields, data field, and the next field.

THE MAIN CLASS

The program runs from this class. It performs the following operations.
1. insertion into linkedlist
2. display initial list
3. insertion at position
4. delete node at a position

LINKEDLIST CLASS

This class has the following
1. insertion method
2. insertion at position method
3. deletion at position method
4. display linkedlist method

NODE CLASS
This class declares variables data and next.
